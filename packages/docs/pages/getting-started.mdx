# Getting Started with the Blue Flag API


## 1: Sign up to the Blue Flag API via blueflag.com.au

To make any request to the Blue Flag API, you must first [sign-up](https://app.blueflag.com.au/get-started) for an account.

Once completed you will be able to add funds to your account and make live requests to the API .  To do this, you will be able to get a set of credentials that you must use toÂ authenticate all requests to the API.

> **Please note:** Your keys and tokens will only display once in the developer portal . It is important that you store these as soon as you generate them.


## 2: Generate your sandbox API key

The Blue Flag API (Application Program Interface), allows you to connect your software to our data.

Our Sandbox environment emulates the behaviour of our production API. It allows your developers to integrate and test at no cost.

To access the [Blue Flag API sandbox](https://app.blueflag.com.au/dashboard), you will need to follow these steps:


<img src= {apiKeysImage} alt='API Image' layout='fill' />


1. Navigate to the '[API Keys](https://app.blueflag.com.au/api-keys)' in your developer Portal


2. Click 'Create Sandbox API Key' button


3. Name your API key and click **'Create & View'**


4. Save your API key somewhere safe and click 'Done'




> **WARNING:** Your API Key will only display once when created. Please store this securely as we cannot show it to you again for security reasons. If a new key is required, your integrations will also need updating.


## 3. Making your first request


Now that you have your API Key, you are ready to make your first request to the Blue Flag API. In this example, we will request a VIN from a registration plate and state entry.

We can request the above endpoint using one of the following approaches:

Example request:

<div className="method-example-code">
    <pre className="IntroSection-pre">

```curl
    curl "https://sandbox.blueflag.com.au/nevdis/vehicle_details?plate=TEST00&state=VIC" \
-H "Authorization: secret_SANDBOX_f1nlZOh0Xr1JvMgJy0d0l9i5JybnBEAYfl7isuU0_o-1GkBsaN8f"
```

</pre>
</div>


## Using cURL

The first approach is to make the request in your terminal using curl. The example above shows how you can retrieve [Vehicle Details](https://blueflag.com.au/docs/api/products/nevdis/vehicle_details/) from a registration plate and state entry. This uses the `vehicle_details` endpoint. 

Replace the example sandbox key in the request above with the sandbox key you generated in step 2 and paste the snippet in your terminal. This will send a request to our API to find Vehicle Details for the plate `TEST00` in the state of `VIC` . 

You will get the JSON response for this request as per below:


<div class="method-example-code">
    <pre className="IntroSection-pre">

```json
{
   "request_id":"6ea677a9-1cd1-4246-913a-4c43a1818940",
   "result":[
      {
         "vin":"KMHH351EMKU00TEST",
         "chassis":null,
         "registration":{
            "plate":"TEST00",
            "state":"VIC"
         },
         "make":"HYUNDAI",
         "model":"I30",
         "colour":"SILVER OR CHROME",
         "body_type":"CAR/SEDAN",
         "vehicle_type":"CAR / SMALL PASSENGER VEHICLE",
         "engine_number":"G40000000000"
      }
   ]
```

</pre>
</div>



## Using Postman

Another way of making your first request to the Blue Flag API is using Postman. This tool lets you make HTTP requests using a graphical user interface. You can specify the request URL, parameters, headers etc.

1. Replace **'Enter Request URL'** with the Blue Flag URL shown in the example above.
2. Switch to the **'Header'** tab, enter in the word **'Authorization'** underneath the KEY column.
3. Paste your Secret Sandbox key underneath the **'Value'** column.
4. To make the request, click **'Send'**.
5. You will then get the JSON response for this request as below.
