                    <p>A VIN is the 'Vehicle Identification Number' attached to any motor vehicle manufactured on or after 1st January 1989. Important Information about a VIN includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A VIN is always 17 characters long</li>
                        <li>A VIN does not contain the letter "o" - it will always be the number zero that appears</li>
                        <li>A VIN does not contain the letter "i" - it will always be the number one that appears</li>
                        <li>A VIN does not contain the letter "q"</li>

                    <h2>What is a Chassis Number?</h2>
                    <p>A Chassis number is the identification number attached to motor vehicles manufactured before 1st January 1989. Important Information about a Chassis includes:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A chassis does not have any specified length</li>
                        <li>A chassis may not be a unique number</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        However there might be some special vehicles produced like plant machinery or specialized vehicles of that sort that might still be allocated a chassis at the time of
                        manufacture even today. This is decided by the manufacturer and beyond our scope of knowledge.

                    <h2>Where to find a VIN on a vehicle?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Vehicle Identification Numbers are located on the vehicle itself, often in numerous places but can also be sourced externally. Many vehicles have a VIN stamped behind the
                        dashboard that can be seen by looking through the bottom corner of the windscreen. Sometimes itâ€™s more visible if you lift up the windscreen wiper arm. The VIN may also appear
                        in a number of other locations. It is always stamped onto the body of the car itself as opposed to a door or boot lid:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Front Of Engine Block</li>
                        <li>Engine Bay</li>
                        <li>Under Rear Wheel Arch</li>
                        <li>Driver Door Jamb</li>
                        <li>Underneath Spare Tyre In Boot</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        If your VIN is still elusive your owners manual should direct you to its location. Alternatively try searching your car model on the internet or contact your local dealer for
                        help. A VIN check can only be done with a relevant VIN.
