                <h3 className="paddingY3">What is NEVDIS?</h3>
                <p className="paddingY3">
                    The National Exchange of Vehicle and Driver Information System (NEVDIS) was established in 1998 and is owned by Austroads on behalf of the eight states and territory jurisdictions
                    that contribute information.
                </p>
                <p className="paddingY3">
                    NEVDIS is a unique national system which enables road authorities to interact across state borders and directly supports the transport and automotive industries. This essential
                    customer service system exchanges national information about vehicles and driver licences.
                </p>
                <p className="paddingY3">
                    In addition to information supplied by road agencies, NEVDIS collects vehicle identification number (VIN) data from vehicle manufacturers and vehicle theft information from police.
                    It also serves information to public and private sector organisations to facilitate provenance checking on vehicles, matching of biographic details on licences, motor insurance
                    underwriting and vehicle safety recalls.
                </p>
