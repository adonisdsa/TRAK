There are two environments to choose from when making requests to the Blue Flag API.


### Live

The live `https://api.blueflag.com.au`
environment is for use in production. It will allow you to access real data that is up-to-date. All requests will be billed according to the appropriate [price lists](https://app.blueflag.com.au/billing/pricing).

### Sandbox

The sandbox `https://sandbox.blueflag.com.au`
environment is used for development and testing. It contains sample data for a set of [test vehicles](https://blueflag.com.au/docs/testing/). No real vehicles exist in the sandbox environment. All requests to the sandbox are free of charge.
