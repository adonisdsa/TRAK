# Submitting an application

To make any requests to the Blue Flag API, you must first [sign-up](https://app.blueflag.com.au/get-started) for an account.

Once you have signed up, you must complete the application form to gain access to pricing and live data. You can access the [application form](https://app.blueflag.com.au/account/apply) here.

As some of the data we provide is from government sources, we need to verify that all users have a current ABN. Please ensure you select 'Company' from the drop down menu which will allow you to enter your ABN.

We will also need your company name, address and phone number.  The business case for using the API data will also need to be complete.

Upon receiving your application submission, we will verify your ABN and company details. You will receive a confirmation email that your application is being reviewed. The approval process usually takes less than one day and you will receive an email when complete.

> **Please note:** If any details from the form are missing, this will slow down the process.
