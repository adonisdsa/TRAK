# Generate live API key

The Blue Flag API (Application Program Interface), allows you to connect your software to our data.

Our production environment allows you to make live data requests. Each request has a cost, as a reminder, you can [view our pricing here](https://app.blueflag.com.au/billing/pricing).

To access the [Blue Flag production API](https://app.blueflag.com.au/dashboard), you will need to follow these steps:
